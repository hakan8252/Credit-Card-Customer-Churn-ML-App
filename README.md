# Credit-Card-Customer-Churn-ML-App

Project Title: Customer Attrition Prediction App

Description:
Developed a Streamlit web application for predicting customer attrition in a credit card dataset. The app allows users to input customer data, dynamically adjusts input parameters, and provides real-time predictions using a LightGBM machine learning model. Users can visualize the impact of different input features and explore the dataset through interactive charts, including bar charts, pie charts, and sunburst charts. The app enhances user experience with a clean interface, predictive analytics, and insightful visualizations.

Key Features:

Streamlit web application for customer attrition prediction.
Dynamic adjustment of input parameters for personalized predictions.
Interactive visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, and sunburst charts.
Integration of a LightGBM machine learning model for accurate predictions.
User-friendly interface for seamless interaction and data exploration. <br/>
Technologies Used:

Python (Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
LightGBM for machine learning predictions
Plotly and Matplotlib for interactive visualizations
Outcome:
A robust and user-friendly application that empowers users to make informed decisions based on predictive analytics and explore key insights within the credit card dataset.
